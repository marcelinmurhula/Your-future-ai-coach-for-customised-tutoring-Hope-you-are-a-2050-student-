VerSel

VerSel is an AI assistant coach that provides customized tutoring by adapting to each student’s thinking style, level, and misconceptions.
Instead of passively consuming content, students must predict, practice, and prove understanding before progressing.

VerSel is designed to make learning active, visual, and impossible to fake.

What VerSel Does

Starts every lesson by asking the student to predict

Explains concepts through short visual explanations

Forces students to practice and demonstrate understanding

Blocks progress until mastery is shown

Adapts explanations based on how the student struggles

VerSel is not a chatbot or a video platform — it is a learning engine.

Current Status

This repository contains an early prototype (V1) focused on validating the core learning loop:
Predict → Explain → Prove → Unlock

The goal at this stage is product learning and user feedback, not polish.

Tech Stack

Built with React + Vite for a fast and minimal development setup.

This template provides:

Hot Module Replacement (HMR)

Modern React tooling

ESLint for basic code quality

Plugins Used

@vitejs/plugin-react — React Fast Refresh using Babel (or oxc)

@vitejs/plugin-react-swc — React Fast Refresh using SWC

React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled by default due to its impact on development and build performance.
If needed, you can enable it by following the official documentation:
https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation

Linting & Type Safety

For production-scale development, using TypeScript with type-aware linting is recommended.
You can start from the official React + TypeScript Vite template here:
https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts

Vision

VerSel aims to become a personalized AI learning coach for complex subjects by:

Adapting to how each student thinks

Measuring real understanding instead of engagement

Supporting education rather than replacing it

**Want me to:**
- Make an even shorter YC-style README?
- Add a “Roadmap (V1 → V2 → V3)” section?
- Rewrite it to target **students**, **teachers**, or **investors**?

Tell me which one.
